## Introduction

**nfcore/nanodemux** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that can be used to demultiplex, QC and map Nanopore data.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Pipeline Summary

1. Basecalling, barcoding and adapter trimming ([`Guppy`](https://nanoporetech.com/nanopore-sequencing-data-analysis); *optional*)
2. FastQ QC ([`NanoPlot`](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot), [`pycoQC`](https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC))
3. Alignment ([`GraphMap`](https://github.com/isovic/graphmap) or [`minimap2`](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2))
    * Convert `.sam` to co-ordinate sorted `.bam` and obtain mapping metrics ([`SAMtools`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html))
4. Present QC for alignment results ([`MultiQC`](https://multiqc.info/docs/))

## Documentation
